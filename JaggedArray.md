Ahh, I see what happened 👀
Your declaration and usage don’t match — you actually **didn’t create a jagged array** there, you created a **2D rectangular array** in C#. Let’s clear it up:

---

### 🔎 What your code means

```csharp
int[][] yoJagged = new int[5][3]; 
```

❌ This won’t compile — because `int[][]` means "array of arrays", so the outer `new int[5]` is okay, but `[3]` doesn’t make sense here.
That syntax is only valid for **rectangular arrays** (`int[,]`), not jagged arrays.

---

### ✅ Two Correct Ways

#### 1. **Rectangular (2D) array**

If you want a true 5×3 grid (like a matrix), use:

```csharp
int[,] yoMatrix = new int[5, 3]; // 5 rows, 3 columns
yoMatrix[0, 0] = 10;
yoMatrix[0, 1] = 20;
yoMatrix[0, 2] = 30;

Console.WriteLine(yoMatrix[0, 1]); // prints 20
```

---

#### 2. **Jagged array**

If you want an array of arrays (where each row can be a different length):

```csharp
int[][] yoJagged = new int[5][]; // 5 "rows" (not yet initialized)

// Initialize each row separately
yoJagged[0] = new int[3];  // first row with 3 columns
yoJagged[0][0] = 10;
yoJagged[0][1] = 20;
yoJagged[0][2] = 30;

Console.WriteLine(yoJagged[0][1]); // prints 20
```

---

### 🔑 Key difference

* **`int[,]`** → rectangular 2D array (all rows same length).
* **`int[][]`** → jagged array (rows can have different lengths, must initialize each row manually).

---

👉 So in your case, if you want a **5×3 fixed grid**, you should use **`int[,]`**.
If you want each row to possibly have different lengths, use **`int[][]`**.

Would you like me to show you a **visual diagram** comparing how these two are stored in memory (so you’ll never confuse them again)?
